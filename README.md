# flipkart_Scrapper
Find data and reviews from flipkart and save them to a database. I used Python and MongoDB to write the script.
I have used BeautifulSoup$ and requests to scrap the data. It is originally Designed for retrieving data about book written by a certain author. But It can be easily modified (by modifying the base url and urls that follow in flipkart.py) to search for any product in Flipkart. It is a very simple script and I am not sure about the efficiency. But It works well for my project. It may have some bugs in there. So any kind of comments and suggestions are most welcome.
You will need a little bit hold on Python, BeautifulSoup and a beginner's knowledge of MongoDB to understand and run the code.
